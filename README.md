# HR Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project involves the development of an interactive Human Resources (HR) Dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee data, including summary insights and detailed records, to support HR managers in decision-making. It is divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis, with interactive filtering capabilities.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in:
- Understanding business and client needs.
- Loading and transforming data.
- Creating calculated measures.
- Building visualizations (bar charts, area charts, maps, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.).
- Designing an interactive dashboard.
- Publishing the project for portfolio collection.

## Features
- **Overview Section**: Displays active (7,984) and terminated (966) employees with area charts and department distribution (e.g., Sales: 1,451, Customer Service: 1,040).
- **Demographics Section**: Includes pie charts for gender distribution (e.g., 54% Male, 46% Female) and bubble charts for education and age.
- **Income Analysis Section**: Features scatter plots for age vs. salary and bar charts for income by education level (e.g., Bachelor: 45%, Master: 30%).
- **Interactive Filters**: Allows filtering by department, gender, education, and other columns.
- **Geographical Visualization**: Map highlighting employee locations.
